In the past two decades alone, NYC has experienced major flooding events that have caused millions of dollars in damage, created major transportation delays, and even cost the lives of New Yorkers. It’s time to get to work and think creatively about how our city handles water.\nGreen roofs are part of the answer and we should be building more of them! They store rain water during storms, relieving pressure on sewer systems. And they have many additional benefits, including:\n\nCooling buildings and the city\nAdding beautiful green space that people can enjoy\nBecoming layover spots for migratory birds"
